## 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Streamlit)
This is a simple and interactive web app built using Streamlit where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Great for learning how to use st.session_state to maintain state in Streamlit apps!

## 🎯 Guess the Number Game

# 👉 [Launch Guess Game Web App on Streamlit](https://guessgame-jrkpyhmpmvqpn26usj7ced.streamlit.app/)


## 🚀 Features
Random number is generated on each game start.

User receives feedback whether their guess is too low, too high, or correct.

Upon a correct guess, a "Play Again" button appears to restart the game.

Uses st.session_state to preserve game state between interactions.


## 🧩 How It Works
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated and stored in the session state.

The user inputs a number and clicks "Guess".

The app gives a hint:

🎯 Correct

🔽 Too low

🔼 Too high

After a correct guess, users can restart the game by clicking "Play Again".
